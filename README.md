The `hostnet/atom-css-sniffer` package is a companion package to the [`hostnet/css-sniffer`](https://github.com/hostnet/css-sniffer) package. It provides the CSS and LESS sniffing in your Atom IDE while you type. It will show any errors in your code.

Installation
------------
 1. Install the [`linter`](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package (with the dependencies) by steelbrain.
 2. Install the [`atom-css-sniffer`](https://atom.io/packages/atom-css-sniffer).

And you are done.

Getting started
------------
Make sure you have a project that has the [`hostnet/css-sniffer`](https://github.com/hostnet/css-sniffer) as a composer dependency and it is installed. If you have that, opening a CSS or a LESS file should trigger the sniffer an will notify you of any errors. 

Everything else is taken care of.
